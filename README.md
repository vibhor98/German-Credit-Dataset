# German-Credit-Dataset
This repository contains the Analysis and Visualization of the German Credit Dataset. It predicts the jobs in which the German credit seekers were indulged in and hence, were most unsatisfied with the salaries that they were getting at that time using the input features like- `Credit Amount`, `Age`, `Housing` and `Duration of loan`.

It can also help in predicting the jobs in Germany that will be least preferred by Germans due to lack of satisfaction they may get in the form of their salaries.
